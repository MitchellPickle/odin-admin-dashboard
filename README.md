# odin-admin-dashboard
The Odin Project's Admin Dashboard.
This project focuses on implementing grids (and some flexboxes) to lay the groundwork of a mock dashboard you would see on the Internet.
You can view my other projects on the home page and also view other pages that I intend to update in the future.

This project is also my final portfolio project for my Advanced Web Programming class at my university.
My commit history details which changes were made during specific time frames (before and after submission).
